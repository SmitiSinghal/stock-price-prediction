# Stock Price Prediction - Regression Problem
## About the project -
The aim is to build a machine learning model for predicting future stock price data. The algorithm used is Linear Regression.


## Steps : 
1. The data is collected from quandl.
2. Data Analysis is done as historical patterns suggest insights into future prices.
3. After the data analysis, data pre-processing is done to get useful information from the data.
4. The model is built and trained using Linear Regression, a supervised ML algorithm used to predict a continuous variable.
5. The model is evaluated using accuracy metrics.
